# Routing Algorithm
## Dijkstra Algorithm

### Overview

The code reads an input file with a given full path through the terminal. The input file must follow
the same format of the example given. The code generates the graph using the ‘Networkx’
built-in library and then runs Dijkstra algorithm on the graph to give out the required data.

The data resulted from running the code:
- The graph for each node
- The Forwarding table
- The shortest path table


> file.txt is just an example file for how the input should look like. Starting with the number of nodes followed by the number of links. Then, all the links with their weights are given afterwards.
